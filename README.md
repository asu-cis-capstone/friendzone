Measurement plan: 
The % of surveyed users who sign up for our service.
The % of people who found an activity in our current list of activities that they would choose to join.

Baseline measurement: 
The % of survey users who signed up for our service = 0%. We had created 3 interview questions to ask each potential client. Of the 5 people that we spoke to on 03/31/2016, our baseline measurement was 0% would be willing to sign-up.


Pitch:
While attending college, it can be difficult to find friends with similar interest. With the busy day-to-day of classes, homework, meetings, and work the FriendZone application can bring people together. FriendZone is a mobile application that will help ASU students find people with similar interests and create friendships through social activities.
