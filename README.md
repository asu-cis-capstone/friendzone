Measurement plan: The % of surveyed users who sign up for our service

Pitch:
While attending college, it can be difficult to find friends with similar interest. With the busy day-to-day of classes, homework, meetings, and work the FriendZone application can bring people together. FriendZone is a mobile application that will help ASU students find people with similar interests and create friendships through social activities.
